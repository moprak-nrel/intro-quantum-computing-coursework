## Prepare the virtual environment

This repository uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the virtual environments and dependencies. To set up the environment, run:

```
bash
uv sync
```

Alternatively, you can use the `pyproject.toml` here with your favorite way to manage python dependences.
